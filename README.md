# Text Adventure

### Description

A text based adventure where scenarios are presented to the player with premade feed back for the player to pick from using the respectives keys. ie. ('1' or '2' and so on)
The Goal as the player is to make it all the way to the dragon and defeat it. The shop and some other features do not work at the moment, but it had all I needed for a project.
